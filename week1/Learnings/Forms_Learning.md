# Forms learnings

within form, we can have <fieldset> <legend> to categorise some fields on UI
like Address for h.no, street, city etc

input type = file -> filter file extension or type using access = ".js"
to send a file with form we need to enc type as multipart form data, 
  
input type = color -> opens a color pallete for user to select any color and then pass on it's value as hex value

input type = date -> provides a date picker -> follows ISO standards
input type = datetime-local -> provides a date picker -> follows ISO standards
