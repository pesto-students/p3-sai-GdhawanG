# Call, Apply, Bind

1. call() :
   The call() allows for a function or method belonging to one object to be assigned and called for a different object. You can refer to the values of the object by using the this keyword.
2. apply() :
   The apply() function works similar to call() function. The only difference between the call() and apply() function is you can pass multiple parameters in the array and use them.
3. bind() :
   The bind() returns the exact copy of a function and binds it with an object. This method is used to bind and keep a copy of a method and use it later. You can use the function whenever you want by invoking it.
